## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** (tested on Ventura & Sonoma)
- **AWS access** with a valid SSO profile in `~/.aws/config` (e.g. `[profile dev-sso]`)

### 1. Install Required Tools

```bash
# Install required packages
brew install colima docker aws-vault

# Optional but recommended for better experience
brew install direnv   # For automatic PATH integration

# Start Docker
colima start --cpu 4 --memory 8
```

### 2. Install AI Sandbox

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/dil-ddaradics/ai-sandbox.git

# Install into your project
./ai-sandbox/install.sh ~/path/to/your/project
```

After installation, you'll see:
```
✔ AI sandbox scripts installed in /path/to/your/project
```

### 3. Set Up AWS Credentials

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/path/to/your/project

# Start the AWS credential server (replace dev-sso with your profile)
ai-awsvault dev-sso
```

### 4. Start a Branch Environment

```bash
# For current branch
ai-up

# Or for a specific branch (creates it if needed)
ai-up feature/my-cool-feature
```

### 5. Launch Your IDE of Choice

```bash
# Launch Claude Code (default)
ai-chat

# Launch VS Code
ai-chat code

# Launch Cursor (falls back to VS Code if not available)
ai-chat cursor
```

### Path Integration

AI Sandbox automatically adds commands to your PATH in two ways:

1. **With direnv** (recommended): Commands are available automatically when you enter the repository directory
2. **Without direnv**: Run commands from your repository root, or add to PATH manually:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/.ai/scripts"  # Add to shell config for persistence
   ```

## Common Use Cases

### Working on Multiple Features Simultaneously

AI Sandbox makes it easy to work on multiple features in parallel:

```bash
# Create environment for first feature
ai-up feature/auth-improvements
ai-chat code  # Open VS Code for this feature

# In a new terminal, create environment for second feature
ai-up feature/new-api-endpoint
ai-chat  # Open Claude in this environment

# Each environment is completely isolated
```

### Managing Your Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Start where you left off
cd ~/projects/my-app
ai-awsvault dev-sso  # Start/refresh credentials if needed
ai-up  # Spin up your current branch

# During the day: Work with your tools of choice
ai-chat  # Use Claude for coding assistance
ai-chat code  # Use VS Code for more complex editing

# Evening: Clean up when done
ai-stop  # Stop the container but keep the worktree
# OR
ai-clean  # Remove container and worktree completely
```

### Collaborating with Team Members

When someone shares a branch with you:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git fetch

# Create isolated environment for their branch
ai-up origin/teammate/feature-branch

# Review their code in your preferred editor
ai-chat cursor
```

### Switching Between IDEs

Seamlessly switch between different development environments:

```bash
# Start with Claude
ai-up feature/new-feature
ai-chat

# Later, continue in VS Code with the same container
ai-chat code

# Switch to Cursor for a different experience
ai-chat cursor
```

## Command Reference

```bash
# Credential Management
ai-awsvault <profile>      # Start credential server with AWS profile
ai-list-creds              # List running credential servers
ai-awsvault-stop           # Stop credential server
ai-test-creds              # Test credential handling in a container

# Environment Management
ai-up                      # Create workspace for current branch
ai-up <branch-name>        # Create workspace for specific branch
ai-stop                    # Stop the container when done for the day
ai-clean                   # Clean up the worktree and container
ai-clean --all             # Clean up and also stop credential server

# IDE Integration
ai-chat                    # Open Claude Code (default)
ai-chat code               # Open VS Code
ai-chat cursor             # Open Cursor (falls back to VS Code)
```

## Configuration

You can customize AI Sandbox behavior by creating a `.ai/.aienv` file in your repository.

### Sample Configuration

```bash
# Claude / AWS Bedrock settings
CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1      # Use AWS Bedrock (1) or Claude direct API (0)
AWS_REGION=us-west-2           # AWS region for Bedrock

# Workspace location
# By default, worktrees are stored in ../worktrees relative to your repo
# WT_ROOT=/custom/path/to/worktrees  # Uncomment to override

# Docker resource allocation
CPU_LIMIT=4                    # Number of CPU cores for containers
MEM_LIMIT=8g                   # Memory limit for containers
```

### Configuration Options Explained

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` | `1` | Whether to use AWS Bedrock (`1`) or Claude direct API (`0`) |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-west-2` | AWS region for Bedrock API calls |
| `WT_ROOT` | `../worktrees` | Directory where worktrees are stored (relative to repo root) |
| `CPU_LIMIT` | None (uses Docker default) | CPU cores allocated to each container |
| `MEM_LIMIT` | None (uses Docker default) | Memory allocated to each container |

> **Note**: When configuring `WT_ROOT`, all worktrees will be organized by repository name. For example, if your repo is named "my-project", worktrees will be created at `$WT_ROOT/my-project/branch-name`.

## Extending

There are several ways to extend AI Sandbox for your specific needs:

- **Add custom packages**: Edit `.ai/Dockerfile` and rebuild with `ai-up --force`
- **Add database sidecar**: Extend `.ai/docker-compose.yml` to include additional services
- **Configure resource limits**: Set `CPU_LIMIT` / `MEM_LIMIT` in your `.aienv` file
- **Add custom scripts**: Place them in `.ai/scripts/` to make them available in all containers

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove from a specific repo
./ai-sandbox/uninstall.sh ~/path/to/your/repo
```

The uninstallation process:
1. Stops any running containers associated with the repository
2. Removes the `.ai` directory containing all scripts and configuration
3. Cleans up PATH entries in `.envrc` if direnv is installed
4. Provides guidance for manual PATH cleanup if needed

# Technical Details

This section covers the implementation details for those interested in how AI Sandbox works under the hood.

## Architecture Overview

AI Sandbox creates an isolated development environment for each Git branch through:

1. **AWS credential management**: A credential server runs once and stays available across terminal sessions
2. **Git worktree integration**: Each branch gets its own worktree in a separate directory
3. **Docker container isolation**: Each branch runs in a separate container with its code mounted
4. **IDE integration**: Containers are connected to Claude, VS Code, or Cursor

## Directory Structure

│   ├── Dockerfile          # Container definition
│   ├── scripts/            # Command-line tools

        ├── branch1/        # One directory per branch
        └── branch2/        # Each with its own container
```

## Credential Handling Flow

AI Sandbox uses a dynamic credential system that automatically adapts to changes in AWS credentials:

    subgraph Host Machine
        aws["aws-vault\nCredential Server"]
        url["~/.ai/awsvault_url\nStored URL"]
        ai-awsvault["ai-awsvault\nScript"]
    end

        refresh["aws-cred-refresh.sh\nRefresh Script"]

        env_file["/tmp/.aws_cred_env\nStores credentials"]
        aws_ops["AWS Operations\n(Claude, AWS CLI)"]
    end

    classDef containerNode fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,stroke-width:2px;
    
    class aws,url,ai-awsvault hostNode;
    class monitor,refresh,entrypoint,env_file,aws_ops containerNode;
```

Key aspects of the credential flow:

1. The `ai-awsvault` script starts the credential server and writes the URL to a file
2. Containers monitor this file for changes and automatically refresh credentials
3. Local URLs (127.0.0.1) are translated to Docker-accessible addresses (host.docker.internal)
4. Credential refreshes happen in the background without container restarts

## Claude Integration

The container is pre-configured with settings for Claude:

- A `~/.claude.json` file skips onboarding and enables permissions bypass
- Claude runs as a non-root user with appropriate permissions
- The container includes tools commonly needed for development tasks

This setup allows Claude to run smoothly in a containerized environment without the usual setup steps required on a local machine.
